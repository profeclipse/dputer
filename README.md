DPuter - A 65c02-based Computr Emulator

Why "DPuter"? It's short for "Da 'puter!" or "Dave's comPuter".

DPuter is an emulator for an as-yet-unbuilt 65c02 computer.

The emulator supports the full WDC 65c02 instruction set. Currently, terminal
and file I/O are provided.

Also included are a kernel and monitor, a feature-rich ANS-Forth, and an implementation
of ehBasic.
